## Project Details
This was a project given to students during Week 4 in the Coding Program at MIT XPro for students to better understand how to manipulate images and how to control the Document Object Model or DOM. 

## Roadmap

In the future, an addition will be made to have a Mrs. PacMan who paces the entirety of the screen and Mr. PacMan will follow her.
